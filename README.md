# 📄 Academic Paper Summarizer using RAG

An AI-powered tool that summarizes and answers questions from academic research papers using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**.

This project is built for the **GenAI4GenZ Hackathon by Intel Unnati** and focuses on handling long academic documents efficiently while preserving technical accuracy.

## 🚀 Features

- 📂 Upload and process academic PDF papers
- 🔍 Semantic search using vector embeddings
- 🤖 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline
- 🧠 Accurate technical summarization
- 🌐 Interactive web interface using Streamlit
- 💻 Optimized for CPU-based systems
- 🔐 Secure API key handling using environment variables

## 🏗️ Project Architecture

PDF → Text Split → Embeddings → FAISS → Retriever → LLM → Summary


### Components:

- **PDF Loader**: Extracts text from research papers
- **Text Splitter**: Divides text into manageable chunks
- **Embeddings**: Converts text into vectors
- **FAISS**: Stores vectors for fast retrieval
- **LLM**: Generates accurate summaries
- **Streamlit UI**: Provides user interface
